## Timeline and Priorities

The development will follow this general timeline, with each phase building upon the previous ones:

1. Phase 1: Core State Management (Initial Release)
2. Phase 2: API Caching Layer (v1.1)
3. Phase 3: Subtree Management (v1.2)
4. Phase 4: Developer Experience (v1.3)
5. Phase 5: Advanced Features (v2.0)
6. Phase 6: Ecosystem (v2.1+)

Each phase will include thorough testing, documentation, and community feedback before moving to the next phase. 

Developer pushes code → CI runs checks → If passes → Ready for merge

Create GitHub release → CD pipeline runs → If passes → Package published to npm
